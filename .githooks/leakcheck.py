"""Shared leak-scanning logic for the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks.

This repository is public and is developed against a real corporate account. The
Trappers API's own responses carry a live person's home address, telephone
number, employer employee numbers and a corporate email domain alongside the two
or three numbers the sensors actually want. Every one of those is one careless
`git add` — or one careless commit message — away from being permanently public.
GitHub keeps deleted content reachable by commit SHA even after a force-push, so
"notice it later and remove it" is not a recovery path. Hence a preventive gate.

── Four lessons are baked into the shape of this file ────────────────────────

1. WHY PYTHON, NOT A grep PIPELINE. The first version filtered added lines with
   `grep -E '^\\+' | grep -v '^\\+\\+\\+'`. On this machine `grep` is ugrep, which
   rejects `^\\+\\+\\+` ("invalid syntax") — the pipeline errored, `|| true`
   swallowed it, and the hook exited 0 on a staged diff containing a live
   corporate email address. It was installed, looked right, and guarded nothing.
   Python's `re` has one dialect everywhere, and every subprocess failure below
   aborts the commit rather than passing it.

2. WHY THE SENSITIVE PATTERNS ARE NOT IN THIS FILE. The second version listed the
   real email address, postal code, phone number and employee numbers inline as
   patterns — and was correctly blocked by itself on the very first commit. A
   public repo cannot carry the list of strings it is guarding; the guard would
   be the leak. So this file holds only patterns that are generic infrastructure
   vocabulary (safe to publish), and loads the identity-specific ones from a file
   outside the repo.

3. WHY .githooks/ IS EXEMPT FROM THE GENERIC PATTERNS. v3 then blocked its own
   test fixtures — test-pre-commit.sh has to contain a sample LAN address in
   order to assert that LAN addresses are blocked. The exemption is scoped to
   .githooks/ and to the generic half only: identity patterns still apply there,
   because .githooks/ is exactly where lesson 2's mistake would land.

4. WHY COMMIT MESSAGES ARE SCANNED TOO. v4 checked only the staged diff. An agent
   working on this repo redacted a real account figure from the tree and from a
   published release note, and then described the same figure in the commit
   message that did the redacting — which the gate never looked at, and which
   cannot be recalled once pushed. A gate that covers the files but not the prose
   about the files is a gate with a door next to it.
